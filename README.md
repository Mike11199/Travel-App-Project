# Travel-App-Project

Using React (Javascript Framework) and following a JavaScript Mastery tutorial for guidance.

Installed following npm packags for this:

  -@material-ui/core
  -@material-ui/icons
  -@material-ui/lab
  -@react-google-maps/api
  -google-map-react

Succesfully managed to use axios and the React Google Maps API to display Google Maps on the screen.  Attempted to use another API Travel Advsior to load locations within the boundary of the map but ran into difficulties. 

Leaving this project as is for reference later; will work on improving understanding of React fundamentals.
